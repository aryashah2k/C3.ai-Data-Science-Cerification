# 1. Setup Your Tools

C3 Platform works best with Google Chrome Web Browser so make sure you work in that supported browser only.

VS Code Editor needs to be installed along with the following packages found in the marketplace:

- C3 AI Development Experience extension 
- REST Client extension for uploading data files to your tag with an API

Note: In order to work in C3 Environment, a tag is needed which is generated by the C3 Team on request when you enroll in the Training Course.

## After Getting the Link for Your Training Environment

### Vanity URL

When your tag was assigned, you should have received an email with a link to your tag's static console. 

The static console is a browser-accessible application (a webpage) that allows you to interact with your tag. The URL you received might look like one of the three types below. 

**Different URLs for a tag**

```
https://training#-c3training-dev#.c3-e.com/static/console/

https://dev#.stageaztraining#.c3ai.cloud/static/console/

https://dev#-idsc3training#.stageaztraining#.c3ai.cloud/static/console/
```

Let's take a closer look at them with examples.

The URL for your console is made up of two parts:

1. The "Vanity URL"

- identifies the cluster, tenant, and/or tag you will be working on for your application.

2. The path to the console

- identifies the address for the C3 AI static console. (There are other paths for different parts of a C3 application.)

Don't worry if cluster, tenant, and tag are not familiar terms to you at this point. You will learn about them in the next module. 

### Open C3 AI Static Console and Google Developer Console

To open the C3 AI static console, simply click on the link you received in your email. 

You will get redirected to a log in page for C3 AI where you need to enter your Okta credentials for single sign on. When you sign in, you will enter your C3 AI static console.

While you are in your C3 AI static console, use the keyboard shortcuts shown to open the Chrome Developer Console.

Now you should be able see your C3 AI static console and Chrome Developer Console side-by-side as shown below.
