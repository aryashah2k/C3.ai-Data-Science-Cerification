# 1. Setup Your Tools

C3 Platform works best with Google Chrome Web Browser so make sure you work in that supported browser only.

VS Code Editor needs to be installed along with the following packages found in the marketplace:

- C3 AI Development Experience extension 
- REST Client extension for uploading data files to your tag with an API

Note: In order to work in C3 Environment, a tag is needed which is generated by the C3 Team on request when you enroll in the Training Course.
